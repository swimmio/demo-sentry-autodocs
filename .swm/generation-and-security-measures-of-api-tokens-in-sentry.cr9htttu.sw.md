# How API Tokens are Generated

API tokens are generated using the `generate_token` function, which utilizes Python's `secrets.token_hex` to create a secure 128-bit token. This ensures that each token is unique and difficult to predict.

```python
def generate_token():
    # `client_id` on `ApiApplication` is currently limited to 64 characters
    # so we need to restrict the length of the secret
    return secrets.token_hex(nbytes=32)  # generates a 128-bit secure token
```
