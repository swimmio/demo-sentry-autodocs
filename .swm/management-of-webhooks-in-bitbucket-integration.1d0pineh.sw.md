# Webhook Management in Bitbucket Integration

Webhooks are managed by checking access to repositories. The `get_hooks` method from `BitbucketApiClient` is called to fetch existing webhooks for a repository. If the repository is accessible and webhooks can be fetched, it returns `True`, otherwise `False` in case of an `ApiError`. This is crucial for managing webhooks effectively within the Bitbucket integration.

```python
        client = self.get_client()
        try:
            client.get_hooks(repo.config["name"])
        except ApiError:
            return False
        return True
```
