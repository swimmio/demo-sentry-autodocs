# Sentry's Migration Management

This code snippet from `migrations.py` shows the initialization of migration processes in Sentry. It includes custom patches through `monkeypatch_django_migrations` and environment settings to manage dangerous migrations.

```python
def migrations() -> None:
    from sentry.runner.initializer import monkeypatch_django_migrations

    # Include our monkeypatches for migrations.
    monkeypatch_django_migrations()

    # Allow dangerous/postdeploy migrations to be run.
    os.environ["MIGRATION_SKIP_DANGEROUS"] = "0"
```

# Custom Migration Handling

Here, Sentry customizes Django's migration executor to ensure data integrity during migrations. The `monkey_migrations` function from `sentry.new_migrations.monkey` is applied to enhance the migration process.

```python
def monkeypatch_django_migrations() -> None:
    # This monkeypatches django's migration executor with our own, which
    # adds some small but important customizations.
    from sentry.new_migrations.monkey import monkey_migrations

    monkey_migrations()
```
