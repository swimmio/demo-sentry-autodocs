# How Sentry Filters Sensitive Data

Sentry utilizes the `sentry.utils.json` module, which is designed to safely handle data serialization and ensure that sensitive information is not leaked in the process.

```python
from sentry.db.postgres.transactions import django_test_transaction_water_mark
from sentry.utils import json
from sentry.utils.strings import truncatechars
```
