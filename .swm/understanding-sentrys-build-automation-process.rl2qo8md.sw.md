# Determining the Need for Building Assets

The `_needs_built` function checks if the assets need to be built by verifying the current package version and comparing it with the static version information.

```python
    def _needs_built(self):
        if BaseBuildCommand._needs_built(self):
            return True
        version_info = self._get_package_version()
        return self._needs_static(version_info)
```
