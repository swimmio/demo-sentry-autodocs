# Session Data Types and Structures

The `SessionsMeta` type and `SessionField` enum define the structure and possible fields of session data in Sentry. These definitions are crucial for understanding how session data is structured and manipulated within the application.

```tsx
export type SessionsMeta = {
  name: string;
  operations: SessionsOperation[];
  type: ColumnType;
};

export enum SessionField {
  SESSION = 'session',
  SESSION_DURATION = 'session.duration',
  USER = 'user',
}

export type SessionsOperation =
  | 'sum'
  | 'count_unique'
  | 'crash_rate'
  | 'crash_free_rate'
  | 'count_abnormal'
  | 'count_errored'
  | 'count_healthy'
  | 'count_crashed'
```
