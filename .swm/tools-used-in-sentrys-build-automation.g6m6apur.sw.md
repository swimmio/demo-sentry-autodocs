# Build Automation Tools in Sentry

This script, `lint_requirements.py`, is part of Sentry's build automation tools. It ensures that Python package requirements are correctly formatted and adhere to defined specifications.

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import argparse
from collections.abc import Sequence

import packaging.requirements


def main(argv: Sequence[str] | None = None) -> int:
    """
    We cannot have non-specifier requirements if we want to publish to PyPI
    due to security concerns. This check ensures we don't have/add any URL/VCS
    dependencies in the base requirements file.
    """
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument("filenames", nargs="*")
    args = parser.parse_args(argv)

    for filename in args.filenames:
        with open(filename) as reqs_file:
            for lineno, line in enumerate(reqs_file, start=1):
```
