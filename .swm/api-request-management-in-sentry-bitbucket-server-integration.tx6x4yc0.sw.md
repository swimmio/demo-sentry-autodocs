title: API Request Management in Sentry-Bitbucket Server Integration
---
This document will explore how API requests are managed between Sentry and Bitbucket Server, focusing on:

# Overview of API Request Management

API requests between Sentry and Bitbucket Server are primarily managed through the integration modules located in `src/sentry/integrations/bitbucket_server/`. These modules handle various aspects of the integration, such as repository management, webhooks, and client API interactions.

# Handling Webhooks

The `BitbucketServerRequestParser` class is crucial for handling webhook requests from Bitbucket Server. It determines the appropriate response based on the type of webhook received.

```python
class BitbucketServerRequestParser(BitbucketRequestParser):
    provider = "bitbucket_server"
    webhook_identifier = WebhookProviderIdentifier.BITBUCKET_SERVER

    def get_response(self) -> HttpResponseBase:
        if self.view_class == BitbucketServerWebhookEndpoint:
            return self.get_bitbucket_webhook_response()
        return self.get_response_from_control_silo()
```
