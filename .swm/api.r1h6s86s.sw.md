# Finding API Endpoints

The list of API endpoints can be found in the `openapi.json` file under the `paths` section. This includes detailed references for each endpoint, such as operations on teams, projects, and organizations.

```json
  "paths": {

      "$ref": "paths/teams/by-slug.json"
    },
