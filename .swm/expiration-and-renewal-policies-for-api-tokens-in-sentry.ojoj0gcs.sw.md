# API Token Expiration

API tokens in Sentry have a default expiration time set by the `default_expiration` function, which adds a timedelta of 30 days to the current time. This is defined by the `DEFAULT_EXPIRATION` constant.

```python
def default_expiration():
    return timezone.now() + DEFAULT_EXPIRATION
```
