# Sentry Overview

Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform that helps developers see what actually matters, solve quicker, and learn continuously about their applications. It supports multiple programming languages and platforms.

# Important Documents

Before diving into Sentry, it's recommended to read the `README.md` for a general overview, and the `CONTRIBUTING.md` to understand how to contribute to the repository.

# Running and Debugging

The main webpack configuration for Sentry's React SPA is defined here. It includes settings for development and production environments, handling of various file types, and optimizations.

```typescript
const appConfig: Configuration = {
  mode: WEBPACK_MODE,
  entry: {
    /**
     * Main Sentry SPA
     *
     * The order here matters for `getsentry`
     */
    app: ['sentry/utils/statics-setup', 'sentry'],

    /**
     * Pipeline View for integrations
     */
    pipeline: ['sentry/utils/statics-setup', 'sentry/views/integrationPipeline'],

    /**
     * Legacy CSS Webpack appConfig for Django-powered views.
     * This generates a single "sentry.css" file that imports ALL component styles
     * for use on Django-powered pages.
     */
    sentry: 'less/sentry.less',
```
