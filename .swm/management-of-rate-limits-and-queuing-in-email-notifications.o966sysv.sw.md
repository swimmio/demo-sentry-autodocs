# Rate Limit Configuration

Rate limits for email notifications are defined here, specifying the limit and the window of time in which this limit applies. This helps in preventing system overloads by controlling the flow of outgoing emails.

```python
        "POST": {
            RateLimitCategory.USER: RateLimit(limit=10, window=60),
```
