# Email Template Structure and Customization

This HTML template file is used to define the structure of email content based on user data. It includes conditional rendering of user information such as ID, IP address, username, and email, which can be customized per the requirements of different error notifications or user preferences.

```html
{% load i18n %}
{% load sentry_avatars %}
{% load sentry_helpers %}
<table class="reset">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <table>
        <colgroup>
          <col style="width:130px;">
        </colgroup>
        <tbody>
          {% if user_id %}
            <tr>
              <th>{% trans "ID:" %}</th>
              <td class="code">{{ user_id }}</td>
            </tr>
            {% endif %}
          {% if user_ip_address %}
            <tr>
              <th>{% trans "IP Address:" %}</th>
              <td class="code">{{ user_ip_address }}</td>
```

# Handling Email Templates

The `__init__` method in `MessageBuilder` class is crucial for setting up email messages. It allows customization of the email subject, body, and headers based on the type of error or user preference. This method also handles the inclusion of dynamic data through the `context` parameter, which can be tailored to include specific error details or user information.

```python
    def __init__(
        self,
        subject: str,
        context: Mapping[str, Any] | None = None,
        template: str | None = None,
        html_template: str | None = None,
        body: str = "",
        html_body: str | None = None,
        headers: Mapping[str, str] | None = None,
        reference: Model | None = None,
        from_email: str | None = None,
        type: str | None = None,
    ) -> None:
        assert not (body and template)
        assert not (html_body and html_template)
        assert context or not (template or html_template)

        self.subject = subject
        self.context = context or {}
        self.template = template
        self.html_template = html_template
```
